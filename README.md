# StayLoggedIn
Want to stay logged in on your remote desktop and tired of continuous disconnection.
I have created a utility
to execute the exe and set the time, it simulates click and escape and keep the session alive.
you are also welcome to contribute.

keep your remote device logged in
Interval : Setup The Time interval from 5, 10 seconds (it is also random 5 will be called between (2 to 5 sec) and 10 will be called between (7 to 10))
It's random so it's not obvious when the mosue move and right click will be called.

Loc - how much the mouse should move 
two ranges 
-(-100,100)
-(-200,200)
